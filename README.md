# Online Bookstore Project

The Online Bookstore project is a web application developed as part of the practical project for the System Analysis and Design course. It allows users to browse and purchase books online.
The project consists of two main components: a front-end web application for user interaction and a back-end API that handles order processing and other business logic.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Backend Environment Setup:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder of the project.
   - Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
     ```
     .venv\scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Run the Backend Server:**
   - Change directory to `bookshop/bookshop`.
   - Start the Django development server by running:
